                        Update: Currently working at Credit One Bank where I am helping the Data Technologies and Innovations team build Data Science and MLOps pipelines for supporting the work of Data Scientists. I am also contributing to the development of a data warehouse for the organization.

                    <p>
                        As a Data Scientist at Social Science Consulting LLC, I worked with <a href="https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/fulton-brad.html">Dr. Brad Fulton</a>, to design state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks based recommendation engine approach for social science networks. The goal was to develop a system that recommends foundations to organizations for charitable purposes in the state of Indiana.

                        At ProMazo, I contributed to the development of a customer retention model for a Fortune 500 banking and insurance client to detect the rate of attrition of customers and suggest alternatives to avoid attrition.

                    <p>
                        Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at HT Media Ltd, a leading Indian mass media organization where I led a team of Data Scientists to develop a recommendation engine for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ht.ottplay&hl=en_US&gl=US">OTTPlay application</a> for generating personalized movie and TV show recommendations for the users. I also led the data engineering team for crawling movies and shows information from OTT websites to reduce costs associated with data collection.

                    During my time at Persistent Systems, I worked on a project to perform sentiment analysis on clients' emails using various Natural Language Processing techniques to understand customer satisfaction with the services provided by the organization.
